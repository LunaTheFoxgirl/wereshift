Submission for Linux Game Jam 2018 (Work in progress)

You are a werewolf, awooo!
Survive as many nights as you can in this semi-stealth game about being a werewolf, lusting for blood.

# Controls
L/R Arrow = Move
Down Arrow = Crouch
Down Arrow (at bush) = Hide in bush
Hold Down Arrow = Transform
Spacebar = jump
Spacebar + Arrow = Jump/attack

Survive as many nights as you can, archers will damage 10 damage extra every night. So in later nights stealth is a must.

# Forms
## Wolf
The wolf runs fast, and is very maneuvrable, but its speed during jumping is not optimal for crowd control
## Werewolf
Can dash through enemies.
## Human
Stealth form, villagers (unless they've seen you transform) will not bother you while human.
